## Report
#### We chose to focus on the transportation sector for our project. There has been a significant increase in the measurement of CO2 emissions, which has resulted in environmental changes. 
#### Our project involves creating a Machine Learning model that employs linear regression to estimate the level of pollution that a car engine could emit. 
#### Our focus is on utilising a Machine Learning approach to address the expected CO2 emissions resulting from vehicles.
#### We collected a large dataset containing diverse varieties of cars from kaggle.
#### ML models we will use for prediction: 
* Linear Regression 
* SVR 
* Random Forest 
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression.

## Streamlit App
#### We've made a simple Streamlit App so we are able to see the result of our top two models. 
#### With the help from rmse and r^2score we see the result from our models.
#### We have also made some histograph and boxplot so we are able to see our predictions better.

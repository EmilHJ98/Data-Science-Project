## Report
#### I chose to focus on the transportation sector for my project. There has been a significant increase in the measurement of CO2 emissions, which has resulted in environmental changes. 
#### My project involves creating a Machine Learning model that employs linear regression to estimate the level of pollution that a car engine could emit. 
#### My focus is on utilising a Machine Learning approach to address the expected CO2 emissions resulting from vehicles.
#### I collected a large dataset containing diverse varieties of cars from kaggle.
#### ML models I will use for prediction: 
* Linear Regression 
* SVR 
* Random Forest 
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression.
